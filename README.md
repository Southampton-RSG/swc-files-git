# Software Carpentry for RAMP - git

This repository contains the demo code used in the Software Carpentry lesson on git.
The code is written in Python, but you do not need to know it. We use the code purely for demonstration purposes.

## Getting The Code

You can 'clone' this repository using the terminal (Mac, Linux) or Git Bash (Windows) by entering the command:

    git clone https://github.com/softwaresaved/swc-ramp-git
